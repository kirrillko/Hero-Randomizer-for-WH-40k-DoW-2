This project is a Hero Randomizer for Warhammer 40k Dawn of War 2: Retribution.

It allows you and your friend to choose a random hero without a risk to choose a hero that you don't want to play.
Select a pool of heroes for both players and click the button => A random hero from custom hero pool is selected for both players.
Hero portraits in this app are much more pretty, than in the game.

Three last heroes (Grey Knights) are unchosen by default for both players, because they are absent on the original game.
The fraction "Grey Knights" is available only in Elite-Mod.
